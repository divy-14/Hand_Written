<h1 align="center">Hand Written</h1>

<p>A Project made with the motive to write no more Assignments. Specially during this lockdown the amount of assignments one need to do has increased significantly. <br><br>
This project will help you get through it!! Upload a .txt or .docx document where you have saved your answers and just upload it on the streamlit portal. Choose from different style options available and BAM!! You have yourself a handwritten assignment that you never actually wrote :smirk::fire:</p>

<p>I have submitted some assignments using it, and you know what it actually worked. And to make it work like this don't send this to your teacher :grin:.  Help your friends though send it to them</p>
